Exploring fine-grained recovery of bounded data sets on Flink
Apache Flink 1.9 introduced fine-grained recovery through FLIP-1. The Flink APIs that are made for bounded workloads benefit from this change by individually recovering failed operators, re-using results from the previous processing step. This blog post gives an overview over these changes and evaluates their effectiveness.
What's New in the Pulsar Flink Connector 2.7.0
With the unification of batch and streaming regarded as the future in data processing, the Pulsar Flink Connector provides an ideal solution for unified batch and stream processing with Apache Pulsar and Apache Flink.
